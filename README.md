# Lead Quality Optimization & ROI Strategy (Aarki Case Study)

This project was completed as part of a take-home analytics challenge for Aarki’s Analyst hiring process. The objective was to evaluate trends in lead quality, identify high-impact features, and assess the feasibility of improving lead quality by 20% in order to justify a 10% increase in Cost Per Lead (CPL) — from $30 to $33. The resulting strategy demonstrated a potential ROI increase from 35.17% to 45.45%.
